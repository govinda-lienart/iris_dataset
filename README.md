In this analysis of the well known Iris dataset, I applied three machine learning methods—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and K-Means Clustering. Using KNN, I classified the flowers based on proximity, visualizing decision boundaries for different feature pairs. Logistic Regression was used for binary classification between Iris Virginica and other species, achieving strong performance with just the petal features. I also applied K-Means, an unsupervised method, to cluster the flowers based on feature similarities. Each method provided unique insights: KNN excelled in classification with clear boundaries, Logistic Regression performed well for binary classification, and K-Means unsupervised method revealed the data’s underlying structure without the need for labels.
